            <p> I created a Contrast poster by taking inspiration from several music festival posters color schemes such as rolling loud I managed to create a contrast by presenting contrasting colours 
                that have very little corralation. I also presented my text in contrasting ways such as size and style.</p>

            <img src="Alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment Image">
            <p>I created an Alignment poster by making a camera that is positioned virtically aligned to the right of the text while also demonstrating the text in an aligned fashion having it the same 
                height as the camera by having the text in diffrent sizes yet keeping the strict line by line Formation. </p>

            <p>I created a Repetition poster by creating a long line of film tape and adding it across the page and also repeating this under or ontop of some of the text in this piece. I also took inspiration

        <p>My journey through graphic and web design has been a fun and productive learning experience for the most parts of this Assesment. Designing 
            the website at first I saw it as a daunting task having no coding experience before university But turning up to lectures and completing the coding worksheets helped me see a clear path to 
            tackle this plan of building my own website. Understanding how to use fonts managing sizes and diffrent colors I enjoyed doing and understand very well however tackling the problems with 
            margins and sizes for images had me stressing and feeling stuck especially for the Typography task so I often turned to my dad who has major experience in coding to help guide me and also problem 
            solve with me to tackle this issue. I also used youtube as a reffrence such as popular youtuber (Bro Code) whilst working with my course mate Campbell to help each other figure out margins 
            and sizes in our code. For the Design section of the course I found this familier and fun as I have had lots of experience with Illustrator and InDesign completeing these tasks I enjoyed and
            had no problems with. Overall I found this assignment a challenge I was willing to tackle that gives me a great sense of pride after completion.</p>
